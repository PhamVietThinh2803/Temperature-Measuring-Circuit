+ 2 buttons to check and adjust the Temperature threshold (Default at 100oC)
+ Temperature range: 0 - 100 oC with resolution of 1oC. Display on LED 7Segments
+ When the Temperature is over the threshold, Led (Yellow) will turn on and can only be turned off when temperature is under the threshold and press the button.
+ Temperature display every 10 seconds to avoid interference.
